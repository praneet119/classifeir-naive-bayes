# classifeir-naive-bayes
contains all the files for naive bayes

Input files are the eattreat articles having postid, title, tags.

files in the folder eattreat classes has been manually calssified into the seven categories.

these are for training the model.

Stemming and lemmatization has been applied on the words before giving them as input the classification model. 

The naive bayes algorithm has been applied on tags.

Naive Bayes algorithm works finest for text classification and small data set(several research papers quoted this)

The algorithm has used laplace estimation by adding 1 to numerator and gradient boosting by adding no. of all tags in all the documents to the denominator

the input is system arguement of tags given in a string.
